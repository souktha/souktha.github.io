.. description: Welcome page
.. type: text

Welcome to my site ! I am a Firmware Engineer working for a consumer electronic company at the west coast of the U.S.
Since my page is being constructed, changes will take place occasionally. I will be adding files to my repository, files that you might find to be useful for whatever you are interested in whether you are an experienced developer or a novice like me.
I will have some boot code, kernel code, verilog code to share later.

Thank you for visiting !
